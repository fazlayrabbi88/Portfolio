            <p class="muted">
              I am Muhammad Fazlay Rabbi, a Software Quality Assurance Engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
              I recently completed my BSc Honours in Computing from the University of Greenwich in 2024 and have been building my career in software testing.<br><br>
              
              I began as an intern at Daffodil Computers Ltd., testing web applications for AIBA, Amar Pharma, and Newtec Pharmaceuticals. I then joined Dream71 Bangladesh Ltd. as a Trainee Software QA Engineer, where I worked on the DLS e-Trade Portal, conducting functional and UI testing across multiple user roles and participating in client meetings to ensure quality alignment with business requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
            I have gained hands-on experience in test case design, functional testing, regression testing, and bug tracking using tools like JIRA and Postman. 
            I have completed professional training in Manual & Automated Testing through Ostad and am preparing for my ISTQB Foundation Level certification.<br><br>
            My technical background includes PHP, Java, Python, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I am passionate about ensuring software quality and delivering excellent user experiences.
